Welcome to my page! 

My name is Zhaocheng (Jerry) Zhang, 张兆成. I am a PhD candidate at Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Oliver Linton](https://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/people/faculty/obl20).

My research primarily focuses on Applied Econometrics and Financial Econometrics. I also have a strong interest in Empirical Industrial Organization and Big Data Analytics in Finance. My ongoing research involves developing and applying tensor factor models to address multi- and high-dimensional problems across various areas of economics and finance.

I am on the 2025-26 job market.
